# JXA (JavaScript for Automation) Limitations in OmniFocus

This document describes known limitations when using JavaScript for Automation (JXA) with OmniFocus, and available workarounds.

## Important Distinction: JXA vs Omni Automation

There are two different JavaScript environments for OmniFocus automation:

1. **JXA (JavaScript for Automation)** - External Apple scripting via `osascript`
   - Used by this MCP server
   - Runs outside OmniFocus
   - Limited API access
   - Directly cannot access RepetitionRule, RepetitionMethod, etc., without using `evaluateJavascript`

2. **Omni Automation** - Internal OmniFocus plugin/script system
   - Runs inside OmniFocus
   - Full API access including RepetitionRule
   - Documented at omni-automation.com
   - Not accessible from external tools

## RepetitionRule Creation - SOLVED with evaluateJavascript() Bridge

### The Solution (Implemented)

We discovered that `Application("OmniFocus").evaluateJavascript()` provides a bridge between JXA and Omni Automation. This allows us to:
1. Create tasks/projects in JXA (for consistency)
2. Apply recurrence rules via evaluateJavascript (accessing full Omni Automation API)
3. Continue working with the items in JXA

### How It Works

```javascript
// In JXA, after creating a task:
const taskId = task.id();

// Apply recurrence via evaluateJavascript bridge:
app.evaluateJavascript(`
  const task = Task.byIdentifier("${taskId}");
  const rule = new Task.RepetitionRule(
    "FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=1",
    Task.RepetitionMethod.Fixed
  );
  task.repetitionRule = rule;
`);
```

### Original Issue (Now Resolved)

The `Task.RepetitionRule` class and related APIs are only available in Omni Automation (internal plugins), not directly in JXA:

```javascript
// These DO NOT work in JXA:
app.Task.RepetitionRule // undefined
app.Task.RepetitionMethod.Fixed // TypeError: undefined is not an object
```

### Impact

- Previously could not create recurring tasks programmatically via pure JXA
- Previously could not create recurring projects programmatically via pure JXA
- Previously could not modify recurrence rules on existing tasks/projects via pure JXA

### Attempted Workarounds

Before discovering the `evaluateJavascript` bridge, several approaches failed:
1. **Direct Constructor Access**: `app.Task.RepetitionRule(ruleString, method)` - Not available
2. **Property Assignment**: `task.repetitionRule = {...}` - Type conversion error
3. **String Property**: `task.repetitionString = 'FREQ=DAILY'` - Accepted but didn't work
4. **Copy from Existing**: Copying RepetitionRule objects between tasks wasn't possible
5. **AppleScript Bridge**: Required privilege escalation and had security issues

### Current Status

Recurrence creation and modification can now be handled through the `evaluateJavascript` bridge shown above. Direct JXA still lacks these APIs, but calling into Omni Automation enables full recurrence support.

### Alternative: AppleScript

AppleScript remains an option if you prefer scripting directly within OmniFocus:

```applescript
tell application "OmniFocus"
  tell default document
    set newTask to make new inbox task with properties {name:"Daily Task", flagged:true}
    set repetition rule of newTask to {recurrence:"FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=1", repetition method:fixed repetition}
  end tell
end tell
```

## Tag Assignment During Creation

### The Issue

Tags cannot be assigned when creating a new task. They must be applied in a separate update operation.

### Workaround

```javascript
// Step 1: Create task
const task = app.Task({name: "My Task"});
doc.inboxTasks.push(task);

// Step 2: Update with tags (must be done separately)
const tag = doc.flattenedTags.whose({name: "work"})()[0];
task.addTag(tag);
```

## Date Handling

### The Issue

OmniFocus expects JavaScript Date objects, not ISO strings.

### Workaround

Always convert date strings to Date objects:

```javascript
task.dueDate = new Date("2025-03-01T17:00:00.000Z");
```

## Performance with whose() Clauses

### The Issue

Complex `whose()` queries can be extremely slow or timeout with large databases.

### Workaround

Use simple queries and filter in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Slow:
tasks.whose({dueDate: {_lessThan: date}, completed: false})();

// Faster:
const allTasks = doc.flattenedTasks();
const filtered = allTasks.filter(t => 
  t.dueDate() < date && !t.completed()
);
```

## Summary

While JXA provides access to most OmniFocus functionality, some features—such as recurrence—require using the `evaluateJavascript` bridge to Omni Automation. AppleScript remains a viable alternative for those who prefer its syntax.
