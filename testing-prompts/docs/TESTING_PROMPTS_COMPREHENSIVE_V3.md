# 🧪 OmniFocus MCP Server - Comprehensive LLM Testing Prompt v3.0

**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing of the OmniFocus MCP server with automatic cleanup mechanisms to prevent test data pollution.

**Target Assistants**: Claude Desktop, ChatGPT with MCP support, or any LLM with OmniFocus MCP integration.

**Version**: 3.2 - Includes automated cleanup strategies, unique tagging system, Claude Desktop UI issue workarounds, and real user testing feedback integration.

---

## 🚨 **IMPORTANT: Claude Desktop UI Issue Workaround**

**Known Issue**: Claude Desktop may occasionally not display MCP tool responses even when they execute successfully. If a tool appears to "hang" for more than 10 seconds:

### Quick Fixes:
1. **Wait 30 seconds** - The tool may have completed but UI isn't updating
2. **Try the same command again** - Often works on second attempt
3. **Use simpler queries** - Break complex operations into smaller steps
4. **Restart Claude Desktop** - Clears UI state issues

### Alternative Query Patterns:
- Instead of: `tasks mode="available" project="My Project"`
- Try: `tasks mode="available" limit="10"` then filter manually
- Use: `tasks mode="today"` for broader queries that typically respond faster

**This is a Claude Desktop UI issue, not an MCP server problem. The server completes operations successfully in 2-6 seconds.**

## 📋 **Real User Testing Results & Known Issues**

**Based on comprehensive user testing with 1,777 tasks, 183 projects, 126 tags:**

### ✅ **Confirmed Working Tools (13/15 = 87% Success Rate)**
- System Diagnostics, Tasks Query, Task Management, Projects (minor format issue)
- Folders, Tags, Productivity Stats, Pattern Analysis, Recurring Tasks
- Perspectives, Export (parameter issue), System Version

### ⚠️ **Known Issues & Workarounds**

#### **1. manage_reviews Tool Issues**
- **Problem**: Tool has internal bugs preventing proper execution
- **Correct Usage**:
  ```
  manage_reviews operation="list_for_review"  # ✅ NOT "list"
  manage_reviews operation="mark_reviewed" projectId="your-project-id"
  ```
- **Workaround**: Use `projects` tool for review-related queries until fixed

#### **2. export Tool Parameter Issue**
- **Problem**: Parameter mismatch causes empty datasets
- **Correct Usage**:
  ```
  export type="tasks" format="json" completed="false"  # ✅ NOT "includeCompleted"
  export type="tasks" format="csv" completed="true"    # For completed tasks
  ```
- **Note**: Tool works but parameter naming is inconsistent

#### **3. workflow_analysis False Failures**
- **Problem**: Claude Desktop UI may not show successful responses
- **Reality**: Tool works perfectly (15-second execution, comprehensive analysis)
- **Workaround**: Wait 30 seconds, try again, or restart Claude Desktop

#### **4. projects Tool Format Issue**
- **Problem**: Returns valid data but also shows error message
- **Impact**: Data is usable, ignore error message
- **Status**: Minor cosmetic issue, does not affect functionality

## 🧹 **CRITICAL: Test Data Cleanup Strategy**

### Unique Test Identifier System
**ALL test data created during this session MUST be tagged with the unique identifier:**

```
@mcp-test-{timestamp}
```

Where `{timestamp}` is the current date and time when testing begins (format: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM`)

**Example**: `@mcp-test-2024-09-24-1430`

### Automatic Cleanup Protocol

1. **Before Starting Tests**: Create the unique test tag using the `tags` tool:
   ```
   tags with operation="manage", action="create", tagName="@mcp-test-2024-09-24-1430"
   ```

2. **During Testing**: Apply this tag to EVERY test item you create:
   - All test tasks
   - All test projects
   - All test folders
   - Any other OmniFocus items

3. **After Testing**: Run the cleanup sequence:
   ```
   # Step 1: Find all test items
   tasks with mode="all", tags=["@mcp-test-2024-09-24-1430"], limit=200

   # Step 2: Delete all test tasks
   For each task found, use: manage_task with operation="delete", taskId="[task-id]"

   # Step 3: Find and delete test projects
   projects with operation="list", limit=100
   # Filter for projects with test tag, then delete each one

   # Step 4: Clean up test folders
   folders with operation="list"
   # Find folders starting with "MCP Test" or tagged appropriately, delete them

   # Step 5: Delete the test tag itself
   tags with operation="manage", action="delete", tagName="@mcp-test-2024-09-24-1430"
   ```

### Manual Cleanup Fallback
If automated cleanup fails, the user can manually clean up by:
1. Open OmniFocus
2. Search for the test tag (e.g., `@mcp-test-2024-09-24-1430`)
3. Select all results and delete
4. Search for projects/folders starting with "MCP Test" and delete
5. Remove the test tag from the tag list

---

## 🎯 Pre-Test Setup & Initialization

### Step 1: System Verification
1. **Verify MCP Connection**:
   ```
   system with operation="version"
   system with operation="diagnostics"
   ```

2. **Confirm OmniFocus Access**:
   - Verify OmniFocus is running
   - Check that you can see existing tasks/projects
   - Ensure proper permissions are granted

### Step 2: Initialize Test Environment
1. **Create Unique Test Tag**:
   ```
   tags with operation="manage", action="create", tagName="@mcp-test-{your-timestamp}"
   ```

2. **Create Test Folder Structure**:
   ```
   folders with operation="create", name="MCP Test Area {timestamp}"
   folders with operation="create", name="MCP Active Tests", parentFolderId="{parent-folder-id}"
   folders with operation="create", name="MCP Cleanup Tests", parentFolderId="{parent-folder-id}"
   ```

3. **Create Master Test Project**:
   ```
   projects with operation="create", name="MCP Testing Session {timestamp}",
   folder="MCP Test Area {timestamp}", tags=["@mcp-test-{timestamp}"]
   ```

**Remember**: Apply your unique test tag to EVERYTHING you create!

## 🧪 Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Test Group 9A: Claude Desktop UI Issues (New!)

**Objective**: Handle Claude Desktop UI responsiveness issues that may occur during testing.

**⚠️ Important**: If any tool appears to "hang" or not respond:

1. **Check MCP Logs** (if accessible):
   - Look for "Message from server" entries
   - Successful operations show complete JSON responses
   - UI hanging ≠ Server failure

2. **Troubleshooting Steps**:
   ```
   # If a query appears stuck, try:

   # 1. Wait 30 seconds - tool may have completed
   # 2. Try a simpler version:
   tasks mode="today" limit="10"

   # 3. Use system diagnostic:
   system operation="diagnostics"

   # 4. Test with different tool:
   projects operation="list" limit="5"

   # 5. If all else fails, restart Claude Desktop
   ```

3. **Alternative Approaches for Stuck Operations**:
   ```
   # Instead of complex project filtering:
   tasks mode="available" project="My Project" limit="25"

   # Try broader query then manual filter:
   tasks mode="available" limit="50"
   # Then look for your project tasks in the results

   # Break into smaller operations:
   projects operation="list" limit="20"
   # Find your project ID, then query tasks separately
   ```

**Success Criteria**: Understand difference between UI hanging and actual tool failure, successfully work around UI issues.

---

### Test Group 9B: Error Resilience

**Objective**: Verify graceful error handling without data corruption.

1. **Invalid Data Tests**:

   # Invalid date formats
   manage_task with operation="create", name="Bad Date Test {timestamp}",
   projectId="{test-project-id}", dueDate="invalid-date-format",
   tags=["@mcp-test-{timestamp}"]

   # Non-existent project
   manage_task with operation="create", name="Bad Project Test {timestamp}",
   projectId="non-existent-id", tags=["@mcp-test-{timestamp}"]

   # Invalid tag operations
   tags with operation="manage", action="delete", tagName="@non-existent-tag"

   # Invalid task operations
   manage_task with operation="update", taskId="non-existent-task-id"
   ```

2. **Boundary Conditions**:
   ```
   # Very long task name
   manage_task with operation="create",
   name="Very Long Task Name {timestamp} " + ("x" * 200),
   projectId="{test-project-id}", tags=["@mcp-test-{timestamp}"]

   # Complex tag combinations
   manage_task with operation="create", name="Many Tags Test {timestamp}",
   projectId="{test-project-id}",
   tags=["@mcp-test-{timestamp}", "@tag1", "@tag2", "@tag3", "@tag4", "@tag5"]
   ```

3. **Recovery Verification**:
   ```
   # Verify system still works after errors
   tasks with mode="all", tags=["@mcp-test-{timestamp}"], limit=10
   system with operation="diagnostics"
   ```

# Get list of test projects
projects with operation="list", limit=100
# (Manual filter for projects with test tag)

# Find test folders
folders with operation="list"
# (Look for folders starting with "MCP Test Area")
```

### Step 2: Delete Test Tasks
```
# For each test task found in Step 1:
manage_task with operation="delete", taskId="{task-id-1}"
manage_task with operation="delete", taskId="{task-id-2}"
# ... continue for all test tasks
```

### Step 3: Delete Test Projects
```
